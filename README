Reads the current kilowatt usage, kilowatt hour used today and used this month
from a TED 1001 (http://www.theenergydetective.com/) and stores it in 
Perceptive Automation's Indigo 4 Home Automation software.

It can use either AppleScript or the RESTful API.

Configuration is now done through preference file instead of the command line.

Copy com.jamus.ted.conf.plist.dist to com.jamus.ted.conf.plist and update 
device and serverRoot to your configuration.  The serverRoot value should
match your app_root_path specified in IndigoWebServer.conf in 
/Library/Application Support/Perceptive Automation/Indigo 4/IndigoWebServer/, 
or "/" if not specified.

A sample launchd configuration file (com.jamus.ted.plist.dist) is also provided,
so that the script starts on bootup.  This file should be updated to your 
configuration, copied to /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.jamus.ted.plist, and loaded 
via "sudo launchctl com.jamus.ted.plist".  Only the RESTful API has been tested,
and I don't expect the AppleScript to work, from launchd.
